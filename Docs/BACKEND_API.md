## Backend API Structure

The backend API will have a GraphQL API endpoint for the project's frontend side of things. Each of the APIs will be used to send or receive data. The API will consist of five key parts -

- [Products](#products)
- [Banners](#banners)
- [Reviews](#Reviews)
- [Authenticate](#Authenticate)
- [Transaction](#transaction)
- [Analytics](#Analytics)

### Products

Any call to the `Products` API should return an array of product objects, where each product object will look like -

```js
{
    name: "Apple",
    description: "A fresh Apple for you!",
    productId: "y3u2uy32",
    imageLinks: ['...', '...', '...'],
    quantityType: "kg",
    averageRating: 4.5,
    reviewCount: 34,
    category: "Fruits",
    price: 3.94,
    brandName: "Green Foods",
    brandLogoLink: "https://....",
    discount: "2%",
    discountedPrice: "$3.69"
}
```

The mongoose schema looks like following:

```js
{
  productId: ObjectID,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  imageLinks: [String],    (URL validation)
  quantityType: String,
  averageRating: Number,          (0-5 stars)
  reviewCount: Number,
  category: String,
  price: Number,
  brandName: String,
  brandLogoLink: String,        (URL validation),
  discount: String,
  discountedPrice: String
}
```

The `discount` and `discountedPrice` values will be used for displaying disconts on various products. These will be calculated and managed by the brands/companies themselves.

### Banners

Any call to the `Banners` API should return an array of banner objects, where each banner object will look like -

```js

    bannerGoToLink: "...",
    text: "..."
}
```

### Reviews

Any call to the `Reviews` API should return an array of review objects, where each review object will look like -

    username: "...",
    userId: "...",
    profilePicture: "...",
    date: "...",
    comment: "...",
    rating: 5
}
```

### Authenticate

The `Authenticate` API can be used to authenticate an user with or without third party OAuth (Twitter, Facebook etc). The details of this API haven't been nailed down yet.

### Transaction

The `Transaction` API will be used to handle user transactions. The details of this API haven't been nailed down yet.

It might be worth checking out [this page](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout). It contains an example of Stripe-hosted secure checkout. Clone the "One time payment" example to see how it was done.
